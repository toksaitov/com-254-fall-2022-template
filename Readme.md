Here all the lab and project sources should be stored and submitted by the
student to his private course repository. The repository MUST be shared with the
instructor and only with him. The student MUST commit and push to GitHub
periodically after finishing work on every part of a lab or a project. The
repository will be checked regularly by the instructor or an automated script
and graded. Ensure to keep the directory in good order. Ensure to follow the
naming convention for directories and files precisely. Your grade will be
lowered if the naming is incorrect and the autograder fails to test your work.

repository will be checked for plagiarism from time to time. In the case of an
infraction, you will be reported to the registrar's office and automatically
